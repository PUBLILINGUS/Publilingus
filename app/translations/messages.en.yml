Against a background of cultural exchange, they decipher the American way of life to better infiltrate the country and implement a terrorist unprecedented operation Devastation."
    pense: "As usual, Palahniuk blows hot and cold, titillating the reader's nerves to the limit of endurance: the anguish of the burlesque, there is only that it crosses with a lot of humor crazy. Served by a language so battered the opportunity for our ideas, reports operator number 67, aka Pygmy, are a delight of its kind: it draws an uncultured American, closed in on itself, lazy glutton and up 'exhaustion. By contrast, the conviction of these young fanatics, the relentless nature of the hatred that drives the reader takes fright."
    culte: "In this small jewel of indecency, Palahniuk continues the work of cutting up the foundations of American mass culture by staging this huge nightmare that the pincers, that of terrorism."

He lives in Washington state and is dedicated to writing. After Choke and The Festival of the testicle, stomach and fever, Pygmy is the fifth book published Denoël Palahniuk."

Tyler says self-destruction is probably the answer.<br /><br />Acid and jubilant metaphor of a world on the brink of chaos, lost for lack of revolution, Fight Club was filmed in 1999 by David Fincher, director of Seven and Alien 3.

In a future where a portion of the population is \"daytime\"and one \"night\"according to a strict curfew, Death takes the form of an oral biography made ​​conflicting reports from witnesses who saw the mysterious Buster near and far. Boy with strange habits, fond of animal bites of all kinds for some funky serial killer or disgusting person for others, the real Buster Casey seems, over the stories, more elusive and protean. Enough to feed the myth ..."
    pense: "In this novel, a sort of eulogy sung by a choir made ​​up of friends, neighbors, police, doctors, critics and admirers, Chuck Palahniuk explores the depths of modern life and portrays in hollow a lot of landmarks in America.
